Invasion is my playground of sorts- there will continue to be sporadic updates, but don't expect anything dramatic. It's posted on Spacebattles as The Undiscovered Galaxy (my username there is XCVG), but I won't post it here until I have enough amassed to form a sort of collection. Among Fighting Men I want to continue, but I don't know if I'll have time, and it's been so long since I last updated I don't know if anyone even remembers it. Same goes for A Balanced Power and A Changing Reality. Everything initially published on April 1st is a joke that I probably won't continue unless there's huge demand for it.
