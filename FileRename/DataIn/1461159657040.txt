"They aren't reporters, Shep," Ilena reminded the poor human. "They're journalists." 
"Blegh."
"You could at least express your disgust in real words." 
"'Blegh' is a word. It got added to the English dictionary in the 21st century." 
Ilena slowly turned to stare at the human in disguise. "Are you serious?" 
"Could you tell if I wasn't?" Shepard returned her stare, except Ilena could just see she was fighting to hold back the faintest grin.
