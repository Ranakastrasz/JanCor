Anyway, sorry about the delay, it looks like the once a week plan for updates might have been a bit optimistic on my part. The next chapter shouldn't take quite as long. The chapter has been beta'd by Wobulator,  for which he receives eternal gratitude!*

*note: eternity not guaranteed. Duration may be restricted to 'until Songless forgets about it and/or you have outlived your usefulness'. See terms and conditions for details.
