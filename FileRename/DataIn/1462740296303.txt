"It makes me wonder what other humans are like, inside that is. Or what they'd become if they lived as long as you have."
Second shook his head.
"You can't even grasp our physical appearance. If you tried to understand human psychology, it would destroy you. Believe me, generations of people have tried and still ended up as mystified as when they began."
"'Can't grasp our physical appearance'? What is that supposed to mean?"
Second held up his hand.
"What colour is my skin, princess?"
"It's sort of-"
"Is it a single colour?"
"What?"
"Is my hand a single colour?"
"Well...Yes."
"To you. That's because I look like a fucking drawing in your world. That's how you perceive me, because how I look in the real world is a blend of thousands of different colours that coalesce into an image more real than can be represented by the sketches and doodles that your world is made from. Humans are more complex, and perfect and terrible than you can ever imagine, and if you saw me in my true form, you would just despair."
Second stopped leaning on the wall and walked past her into the corridor she just came from, heading in the direction of the throne room. As he went, he reloaded his shotgun. Once Second was gone, Celestia shuddered.
I don't refer to us as Elder Gods for nothing.
