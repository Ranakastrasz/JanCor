Bitch as the star of a shoujo manga -or I guess a Sailor Moon-esque manga, more- is ahilarious mental image. She is like theantithesis of manga Standard Girl Tropes. It would either be glorious or godawful. Maybe both.

"Hi, I'm Rachel Lindt, and I'm not even slightly an ordinary girl. Also, fuck you, stop reading my thoughts."

"You're making eye contact with me through this panel. Stop it, asshole."

"I go to Winslow High. It's a hole."

"This is my dog, Brutus. If I had to choose between his life and yours, dear audience members, I'd choose him in a heartbeat."

"This guy is making eyes at me. Lisa tells me it's because he likes me. My gut tells me it's because he's challenging my dominance of the pack." *cracks knuckles* "I'm going to go fix him." (Ignore the shoujo sparkles on the handsome, debonair boy, because Bitch is most certainly ignoring them)

"I work with a criminal gang of smalltime parahuman thugs. I love my job. I get to break people and make money while doing it. Now if only I liked the people I was working with."

"I call this special dramatic manga attackHURT, BRUTUS!" *Glances at the audience*"Flowery attack names are stupid. You're stupid for wanting them
