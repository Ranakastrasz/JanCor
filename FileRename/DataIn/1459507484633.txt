"It's crap we salvaged from the bottom of the fucking ocean on Earth Bet." Steve countered.
"Spoken like a true neanderthal. These are treasures believed lost with the ships that carried them, each a little bit of Earth's history and worth far more than the metals or stones in them."
"Spoken, like a used car salesmen, right before he talks you into buying a lemon."
