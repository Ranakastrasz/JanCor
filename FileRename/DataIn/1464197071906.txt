reclaim
cast ally or neutral

on death, no death boom. instant start reclaim

on neutral/wreckage, same, but gain back 90% mass, 10% energy value

autocast? on ground cast queue? 

on unit fatal damage from damage function, set to 100% HP - overkill. set to neutral owner. aircrash and boom. allow reclaim. take damage after as normal. break all target locks. 1 sec invulnerable? ward it? pause it?

if cast assist on structure wreckage, rebuild?
