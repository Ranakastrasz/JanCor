The existence of the Endbringers is one of the key aspects to how the setting works. Leviathan is among the very few things I have ever seen to deserve the name, and his powers are quite frankly, beyond terrifying. 
There existence also leads to two of my favorite setting elements, the Truce, and the associated understanding that "No, we have more important things to do." And the small thing thing that we only see shades of, no one blames you for running away. Everyone who wants to help is welcome, those who don't are free to walk away.
