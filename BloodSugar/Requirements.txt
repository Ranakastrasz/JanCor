 
I need to be able to run an app on my android phone.
 
When it starts, it pops up a initial screen, were I can add a blood sugar reading
 
I am not required to add a blood sugar reading.  I can be there just to look at my readings.
 
 
Readings can be 50 .. 400.  Anything out of range is simply rejected.
The units are mg/dl.
 
 
Readings are saved in an editable text file, so that corrections can be made.
 
 
The main screen shows
 
Blood sugar average for the day
Blood sugar average for the week
Blood sugar average for the month
Estimated A1C Level, based on all data
 
 
From time to time, I need to throw away all of the data and start from scratch.
That functionality should be in the app.
 
 
Your turn to ask questions.

Put the old icon back on.
 

New Requirement.

 

                Business requirement…   Make weekly backups so there is a fallback position when things go bad.

 

                If the day is Saturday, create this file name pattern using the date “YYYY-MM-DD.txt”

                If that file exists in the records directory, then stop.  Otherwise…

                Copy records.txt to the file pattern above,  then stop.

 

                There is no need to do maintenance on those files, just let them accumulate in the folder.
