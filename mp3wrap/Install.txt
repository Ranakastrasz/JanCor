         INSTALLING INFORMATIONS FOR WINDOWS VERSION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to get your mp3wrap installed is to copy just the file mp3wrap.exe
(included in package) in Windows main directory (usually C:\WINDOWS).

Or, for more experienced users: you can extract mp3wrap.exe in another directory
and then add that directory to PATH environment.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: MP3WRAP IS A TEXTUAL UTILITY. TO RUN USE MS-DOS PROMPT!

  For people who don't know how to use ms-dos prompt:
  - First copy mp3wrap.exe as described before.
  - Run MS-DOS prompt in Start Menu -> Accessories
    or just Choose Start -> Run... then type
    command
  - You will have a black window writing C:\WINDOWS or something similar.
  - Now you have just to move to directory where mp3 are using 'cd' command:
    cd X:\directory1\directory2\mp3\mymp3\
    where X is the the drive (for example C or D)
  - Ok, now just type
    mp3wrap
    you will se an help message on how to use mp3wrap.

  From this point you will be able to use mp3wrap correctly.
  Please read man.html and faq.html for a complete documentation and example of use.

  I know, you are thinking all this is too difficult. This is not true, listen me;
  I can assure that once you get experienced using this program you will be really
  fast. Is faster to open a window program, selecting all files to open, select
  output file and then start, or instead to write only: mp3wrap out.mp3 *.mp3 ?? ;)
  However don't worry, I will try to write a Graphic Interface as soon as possible.
